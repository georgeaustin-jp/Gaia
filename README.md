*v0.1.3-alpha*

*See `patch_notes.md` for additional information about this version*

## Description

Gaia is a turn-based combat game, taking inspiration from Terraria, Pokémon and a large variety of other games. It is designed to run well on almost any computer, no matter how low-power it may be.

## Installation guide

Download and unzip the latest release from the **Releases** section. In the terminal, change the directory to `Gaia` and execute the following command to begin the game:
```
python src/main.py
```

## How to play

Equip up to 3 weapons and 4 equipables before entering combat. Weapons deal damage and can parry. Equipables increase your damage resistance by up to 5% each.

For each round of combat, you can select 2 actions out of the following:
 1. Attack an enemy
 2. Parry attacks
 3. Heal

Once you have selected your actions, the enemies will select theirs. The actions of both sides will then be executed in sequence.

You win once all your enemies have been killed. If you are killed, then you die and return home.
